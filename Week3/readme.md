# Pixel x Pixel Week 3 Assignment :space_invader:

*Suggested exercise â€” Create a painting app, something that applies colors or paint or texture as the user moves the mouse or some other interaction.*

-------------------

For this assignment, I prioritized the following specs:  
- user input via mouse
- directly manipulating pixel arrays via `loadpixels()`
- modularized "super pixel" approach

Here is a gif of the result:  
[INSERT GIF]  

Each "super pixel" is rendered as a `PGraphic`.

It's appearence is generated by running the following mathematical formula on the `PGraphic`'s `pixel[]`. Below is a Grapher image showing the basic formula. Colors are derived from a combination of the formula as well as the super pixel's distance from the mouse.


The appearence of each individual pixel can be manipulated by changing the formula.

### TODO
- mouseless mode
- reading wacom pen pressure
- convert to OF and test speed
- play with location lerp()
- any way to optimize equation?
